create a new database file with command 
C:\sw\h2\bin>java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Shell
it asks for the url. give the new db name jdbc:h2:~/testsakila
dont enter anything for user. it will take sa for default. then it will ask for password and confirmation password.
then the file is created at home directory. then execute the next scripts to create data that is needed.

C:\sw\h2\bin>java -cp h2-1.4.193.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:~/testsakila;MODE=Oracle -user sa -password test123 -script c:\Users\vamsi\Downloads\oracle-sakila-db\oracle-sakila-schema.sql

C:\sw\h2\bin>java -cp h2-1.4.193.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:~/testsakila;MODE=Oracle -user sa -password test123 -script c:\Users\vamsi\Downloads\oracle-sakila-db\oracle-sakila-insert-data.sql

file will be present in home directory with testsakila in name

start the tcp server with the command   java -cp ./h2-1.4.197.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcp
db is not opened till client connections are established. when client tries to connect, db url needs to be supplied
